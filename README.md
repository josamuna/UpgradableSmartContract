# Upgradable Smart Contract Task

## The following are the details of the task for creating upgradable smart contracts-

1. Use Transparent Proxy Pattern and Gnosis Multisignature wallet for the implementation.
2. You can refer the document under the resource section of 8th February live class to perform this task
3. The pattern for this upgradable contracts is divided into three phases of upgradable smart contract- Phase 1- contract version 1, Phase 2- contract version 2 and Phase 3 - contract version 3.
4. *Phase 1*- Create a simple ERC20 contract with a pre-minting of 1 million tokens
5. *Phase 2*- Add the functionality to mint and burn tokens, add allowance mechanism functions. All payable and transaction functions should be implemented using the call method.
6. *Phase 3*- Add Reentrancy Guard for vulnerable functions(use a custom modifier to implement reentrancy guard), add onlyOwner modifier wherever necessary(use custom modifier for this implementation).
7. Perform testing for all the phases.

> Note- All features from Phases 1,2 and 3 should be able to be executed directly using the Proxy Address from goerli etherscan.
